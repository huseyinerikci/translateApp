# Translate App
This project is a translation application built using React.js, Redux Toolkit and Tailwind CSS. The project includes a number of features such as data management with Redux Toolkit, data retrieval from external API via RapidAPI with Axios, and dynamic selection interface to the user with React-Select. The project can also be used comfortably on every device with responsive design. A modern and stylish loading animation has been added with the Uiverse.io service.
The aim of the project was to learn in depth the use of Redux and Redux Toolkit and see how we can manage the data flow using these tools.
